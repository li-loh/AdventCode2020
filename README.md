# AdventCode2020
This year, I'm going to use Kotlin programming language to work through Advent Code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020) as I'm currently learning Kotlin. 

## Tech Stack:
- Kotlin
- JUnit5
- IntelliJ

## Decisions:
- Each day or part day challenge will be completed as an independent function which will be run via a unit test. This allows me to refactor the implementation as needed since there is a test to verify the output is still correct.
